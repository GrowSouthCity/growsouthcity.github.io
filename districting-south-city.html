                <p>South San Francisco is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ssf.net/government/district-elections">switching to district elections</a> over the next few years (to avoid a costly legal bill!) and the city's asking for citizen input on how to assign the districts. I fun creating and submitting a couple of my own district maps and I thought I'd explain how and where to do your own.</p>
<p>There are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ssf.net/government/city-council/district-elections/map-the-districts">Excel and paper copies of the redistricting maps</a> available, but I found the <a class="reference external" href="http://lexington.caliper.com/southsanfrancisco/">web-based mapping tool</a> much faster (once I was over the learning curve) because I was able to very quickly see how many people I put in each district and what parcels I could move back and forth between the districts. For the web mapping tool, there's a <a class="reference external" href="http://lexington.caliper.com/southsanfrancisco/help/quickstart/QuickStartGuide.htm">&quot;quick start&quot; guide available</a> and you can get to the <a class="reference external" href="http://lexington.caliper.com/southsanfrancisco/">tool itself here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Use a throwaway password for the tool, because the website login isn't secure and it's possible a hacker could get it.</p>
<p>There are options for four or five districts that preset the desired number of residents for each district. I chose the five district one; it has the advantage of each council member having few constituents and hopefully therefore being more responsive to their needs.</p>

<p>Once you're logged in, it looks like the picture above. Besides the zoom and pan tools on the map itself, the main thing you'll be doing is clicking each parcel with the little &quot;cursor with a star&quot; tool or a group of parcels with the &quot;dashed outline&quot; tool and clicking the &quot;green check mark&quot; to add them to the current district (either &quot;New District&quot; or an existing district from the drop down menu). All these tools are in the &quot;Redistricting Toolbox&quot; in the upper left.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Some things I learned:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Keep an eye on the window below the map (&quot;Districts in Plan&quot;) that shows the population deviation from the allowed. Your largest and smallest districts have to be within 1,273 people of each other for the five-district map or the city won't accept it (subtract your lowest negative number from your highest positive number).</li>
<li>Westborough is just slightly too big to make all of the districts evenly balanced; either you need to split it in two or just accept that one of your districts is going to have several hundred extra people. Splitting it is bad for the Voting Rights Act as it's a majority Asian district and you're not supposed to gerrymander minority neighborhoods although I'm not sure how rigorous this is weighed against keeping the neighborhoods the same size.</li>
<li>Downtown is a little tricky too because it's a majority Latin district (so once again it's difficult to split through), but it's relatively easier to keep a neighborhood here than in Westborough.</li>
<li>There are a bunch of tiny industrial or highway areas you might miss. Click the Plan Integrity menu and then &quot;Find Unassigned Areas&quot; to go through these and add them to your districts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a side note, our current city government is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council%E2%80%93manager_government">council-manager system</a> where the mayor is basically a ceremonial position and the city manager does all the day-to-day management with supervision by the council. I'm not sure how directly-electing a mayor would change the position (versus having the mayor be rotated among council members as it currently is), but I'm curious to hear more about that proposal especially as it seems like a more significant change.</p>
<p>I hope you find this useful and have fun!</p>
